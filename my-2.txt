Working Directory and Staging Area (Index): Shows changes that are staged but not yet committed.
Staging Area (Index) and the HEAD Commit: Shows changes that are staged and ready to be committed.
Working Directory and the HEAD Commit: Shows changes made since the last commit.
Here are some common use cases for git diff:

To see changes between the working directory and the staging area:

bash
Copy code
git diff
To see changes between the staging area and the HEAD commit:

bash
Copy code
git diff --staged
To see changes between the working directory and the HEAD commit:

bash
Copy code
git diff HEAD
To see changes between two commits:

bash
Copy code
git diff <commit1> <commit2>
To see changes in a specific file:

bash
Copy code
git diff <file>
You can also add various options to git diff to customize its behavior further. For example, --color-words highlights changes within lines instead of whole lines, and --word-diff shows changes at word level. Additionally, you can use -R to reverse the order of comparison, showing changes as additions rather than deletions, and vice versa.
